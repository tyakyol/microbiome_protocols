## Preparation

### Seeds
- Lotus-gifu and lotus-symrk-3 seeds were sterilized and geminated for 3 days

10 plants per pot 
4 biological replicates

### Pots
-	Small mesh pots were sterilized by ethanol and UV for 15 min
-	Medium size pots were sterilized by ethanol and UV for 15 min
-	Large white boxes were autoclaved
-	Purple 1 ml boxes were autoclaved

### Substrate
-	Large leca and small leca were autoclaved
-	Vermiculate was autoclaved
-	Autoclaved soil
-	Non-autoclaved soil

### Media
-	Sterilized water
-	Long Ashton: 1N1P media

### Inoculation
-	Re-grow full LjSyncom from glycerol stocks according to their growth time. 
-	Wash the strains by centrifuging the plates down at max speed for 5 min and resuspend them in 1N1P media. Repeat this twice.
-	Re-grow only Lj symbiont from glycerol stocks according to its growth time

Measure the OD by Varioskan and pool the strains to a similar ratio of strains. Measure OD and dilute this mixture to OD600=0.02

Soil was in this experiment the inoculum as well.

## First overview of the growth set up
-	Into small mesh, pots add small leca and vermiculate on the top â€“ this will be set up for 14 days.

## Planting plants into the pots
Following steps are performed usually in the institute. To avoid disturbing the plants.

-	Before planting plants into pots, water either with sterilized water or with media the pots until you can see liquid coming of the pots. 
-	Cover the pots by plastic (autoclave bags) for 3-7 days. At this point watering will not be very much necessary but check on the plants every other day.

## Second overview of the growth set up
These pots will be needed on the day of inoculation (14 days post planting plants)

-	On the bottom of the medium size pots add handful of the large leca. 
-	On top of the leca add soil (inoculated or non-inoculated) but not to the very top!
-	Take the small mesh pots and place them on top of the middle size pots- Push a little without disturbing the plants. 

## Inoculation
After 14 days from planting plants into the small, mesh pots. 

-	Add 20 ml of inoculum of OD600=0.02 per pot, either full Lj Syncom or only Lj symbiont
-	Add 1 mL of AM spores (500 spores)

Grow these plants for 28 days.
Harvested compartments are rhizosphere (RZ), endosphere-rhizoplane(ES)- water wash and nodules (NOD)

This whole experiment was performed twice. One set was for 16S Microbiome library and second set was for RNA extraction and sequencing.
